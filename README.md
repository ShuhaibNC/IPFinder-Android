# IPF - IP Finder

IPF (IP Finder) is a lightweight Android application that displays the IPv4 address of `ap0` or `wlan0` interfaces **without requiring a WiFi connection**.

## 📱 Features

- Shows local IPv4 address of `ap0` (Hotspot) and `wlan0` (WiFi) interfaces.
- Does **not require** an active internet or WiFi connection.
- Copy IP address to clipboard with a single tap.
- Built-in refresh button to update IP info.
- Simple, fast, and effective!

## 🔧 Use Case

This app is especially useful for developers, testers, or tech enthusiasts who:
- Run servers on Android (like HTTP file servers).
- Need local IP for ADB over WiFi or similar.
- Want to debug or view local network interfaces quickly.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The app queries available `NetworkInterface`s, then checks for `wlan0` or `ap0`. If an active IPv4 address is present, it displays it.

```java
if (networkInterface.getName().equalsIgnoreCase("wlan0") ||
    networkInterface.getName().equalsIgnoreCase("ap0")) {
    // Fetch and return the IPv4 address
}
```

If no IP is available, it shows `127.0.0.1` with a warning.
